Development instructions:

1. (Optional) make a nodeenv
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Go to localhost:3000/card-creator

If I ever disappear or stop paying my hosting bills, someone else can get the basics (without share links) running. You don't even need a desktop, just a phone:

1. Make a github account and fork the repo
2. Make a cloudflare pages account and make a new Worker & Pages linked to the repo.
3. Have the build command be "npm run build && mv build card-creator"
4. Each time the repo updates, the project will make a new deploy
