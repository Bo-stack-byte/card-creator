  <p>many years ago <a href="https://withthewill.net/threads/digimon-card-game-blank-templates.23126/">Quietype over on
      WithTheWill</a> came up with the original card templates, and also eyeballed the fonts in use on the official
    cards. he probably didn't expect that lots of people would stick to his initial thoughts years later.</p>

  <p>this is a guide on reverse-engineering the fonts in question.</p>
  
  <p>if you want to suggest a new font, specifically cite at least 1 glyph that is a better match to the card text. 
    if that causes some other glyphs to be wrong, that's okay, we won't have to use the new one but knowing what pieces we need is valuable</p>

  <p>if a font on this page isn't loading, it will default to <span style="font-family: XXXX;">Times New Roman like this</span>
