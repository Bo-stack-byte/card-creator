feedback on this list appreciated. 
just a few people asking for a feature makes it very likely to exist, even if it already is listed here.
take this as a brainstorming list of ideas.

KNOWN BUGS

* ESS picture not using bbackground
* multiple users reporting Safari issues (bad scaling, bad font on mon name). if this includes you, please reach out
* fix those extra pixels at intersections where angles jut out
* (maybe same issue) Keywords that appear far along the line may be mis-aligned. So do [] symbols
* the black color isn't quite black; try black/green egg and look closely at attribute bar

VAGUE TO DO LIST, SOONER:

* rainbow color in evo circle needs white text w/black border
* better browse of images (see your own w/priority and page through others)

MEDIUM TERM:

* Monsters with Security effect icons (brand new layout, new Security box)
* font check page
* brick art
* full color border art (PARTIALLY DONE)
* standalone binary, so local images can be accessed
* get purple text with (parentheses) or fix in import for translation team's format
* sample free form for ACEs, and/or better ways of detecting ACE

VAGUE TO DO LIST, LATER:

* make ACE text fully generated and customizable
* flower frame? like EX5-048 EX6-012
* draw name bar with vector graphics instead of layering up images
* - for level ?
* more Ayar Kasone as backup when the user doesn't have Helvetica Neue: especially DP
* get brick backgrounds when we have more samples
* get link frames when we ahve more samples
* for frame-less ACEs, still have frame stuff at bottom, and make ESS transparnets
* ... but ACEs may also be getting rid of ESS text, so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* option for smaller download (4 MB can be a lot for 1 card)
* make default font for level text (before remote font loads) less ugly
* for remote fonts, delay first rendering or re-render when it loads
* handle too-large text in a better way
* get faint white glow in playcost circle
* save final art and user art with link
* browseable gallery of all saves
* user accounts
* better parsing of custom card formats
* maybe pre-BT14 styles as an option
* Burst digivolve format
* populating inherit box at the bottom with art
* (maybe auto-guessing where the "face" is for that)
* new security icons
* add triangle to "Rule" text
* for options, use black text (with optional white outline)
* for white cards, make text black with white outlines white cards
* black level box not quite right in shape and size if you look really closely

NOMINALLY FIXED BUGS / FEATURES

* rarity icons, block icons
* "use cost" instead of "cost" for options
* "new card" copies current card
* squeeze rule text as needed to fit in 1 line
* pen for creator name (should credit both artist and author)
* some timings [in brackets] not blue, again
* put all variables into json blob
* digixros field goes nuts if it doesn't start with [digixros -x]
* Keyword scrunching (try sample ACE with fontsize 140): can't reproduce this even going back a few weeks
* bubble around digixros wrong length? don't know what this was any more
* dual-layer art (user supplies background and foreground: foreground gets drawn over background)
* digimon name for pure yellow/pure white should be solid black, not white with black border
* Digixros and "rule" text overlaps.
* lower name on options/tamers when no traits
* the same way you set color to "green/red" people expect to be able to set the digivolve for a level to be "green/red" instead of needing 2 separate lines
* costs in digivolve circle should only have a border if one color in the multi-color demands it
* rounded corners not quite right on full art
* lower name when no traits
* rounded corners not quite working on download
* ACE frames with the fancy lines (sort of working already but not really)
* sometimes the evo circle colors don't populate
* "Effect box" doesn't always show up right away when clicking check box and it's making me angry
* make squares transparent for all inherits
* assumes only 1 digivolve circle ever needed, mangled art if they're mixed (and can't handle "tamer")
* color cicle replacement everywhere (might be done now)
* 0 DP
* default to array for JSON
* multiple evo circles with different cost/color
* add/remove digivolve condition button
* shell without egg 
* auto-generate all images with one click (for testing)
