Feedback on this list appreciated. Just a few people asking for a feature makes it very likely to exist.

BUGS

* bubble around digixros wrong length
* assumes only 1 digivolve circle ever needed, mangled art if they're mixed (and can't handle "tamer")
* digimon name for pure yellow/pure white should be solid black, not white with black border
* fix those extra pixels at intersections where angles jut out
* Keyword scrunching (try sample ACE with fontsize 140)
* (maybe same issue) Keywords that appear far along the line may be mis-aligned. So do [] symbols
* Report of scaling broken on Safari (unable to reproduce so far)
* "Effect box" doesn't always show up right away when clicking check box and it's making me angry
* digixros field goes nuts if it doesn't start with [digixros -x]

VAGUE TO DO LIST:

* option for smaller download (4 MB can be a lot for 1 card)
* default font for level text (before remote font loads) is really ugly
* for remote fonts, delay first rendering or re-render when it loads
* pen for creator name (should credit both artist and author)
* handle too-large text in a better way
* get faint white glow in playcost circle
* dual-layer art (user supplies background and foreground: foreground gets drawn over background)
* save final art and user art with link
* browseable gallery of all saves
* user accounts
* better parsing of custom card formats
* maybe pre-BT14 styles as an option
* rarity icons
* Burst digivolve format
* color cicle replacement everywhere (might be done now)
* populating inherit box at the bottom with art
* (maybe auto-guessing where the "face" is for that)
* new security icons
* add/remove digivolve condition button
* add triangle to "Rule" text
* for white mon, use 
* black level box not quite right in shape and size if you look really closely

NOMINALLY FIXED BUGS / FEATURES

* Digixros and "rule" text overlaps.
* lower name on options/tamers when no traits
* the same way you set color to "green/red" people expect to be able to set the digivolve for a level to be "green/red" instead of needing 2 separate lines
* costs in digivolve circle should only have a border if one color in the multi-color demands it
* rounded corners not quite right on full art
* lower name when no traits
* rounded corners not quite working on download
* ACE frames with the fancy lines (sort of working already but not really)
* sometimes the evo circle colors don't populate
